# Milestones and Resourcing

 - After identifying the problem and solution and confirming technical feasibility and value, the next steps involve detailing key project specifications;
 - This step includes:
    - **Machine Learning Metrics**: specify metrics like accuracy, precision-recall, and fairness metrics, if applicable;
    - **Software Metrics**: outline software requirements such as latency, throughput, and queries per second, considering available computational resources;
    - **Business Metrics**: estimate potential business impacts, such as incremental revenue.
    - **Resource Requirements**: Identify necessary resources, including:
      - **Data Needs**: Determine how much data is required and from which teams.
      - **Personnel**: Identify any cross-functional team support needed.
      - **Software Integrations**: Specify software and data support required from other teams.
      - **Timeline**: Set a timeline for achieving milestones and deliverables.

# Benchmarking and Proof of Concept (POC)

 - If itâ€™s challenging to define specifications, consider benchmarking against similar projects or developing a POC;
 - This can provide insights into feasible metrics like accuracy and latency, helping to refine the project scope.
