# Initial Brainstorming

 - Collaborate with business or product owners to identify business problems rather than AI-specific issues;
 - Example: In an e-commerce context, ask about key areas for improvement (e.g., increasing conversions, reducing inventory, increasing margins);
 - Emphasize that the focus should be on business challenges.

# Separating Problem Identification from Solution Development

 - Identify the business problem first, which can lead to more effective solutions;
 - This approach aligns with principles of design thinking.

# Assessing Feasibility and Value

 - After brainstorming AI solutions, assess their feasibility and potential return on investment (ROI);
 - If an AI solution appears promising after validation, outline project milestones and budget for necessary resources.

# Key Considerations

 - Encourage brainstorming many possibilities (divergent thinking) before narrowing down to the most promising ideas (convergent thinking);
 - Avoid jumping into the first exciting project without considering its potential value compared to other options;
 - Aim to ensure that the selected project provides significantly higher value compared to alternatives, optimizing the effort and resources spent on the project.
