# Understanding Metrics

 - Estimating the value of a machine learning project can be challenging due to differing metrics prioritized by machine learning engineers and business leaders;
 - For example, while engineers may focus on word-level accuracy in a speech recognition system, business stakeholders often prioritize query-level accuracy and ultimately the quality of search results, which drive user engagement and revenue.
 - To align the technical and business teams, itâ€™s important to reach a compromise on metrics that satisfy both sides. This often involves each team stretching their comfort zones to create value for the business.

# Bridging the Gap

 - Performing rough calculations (Fermi estimates) to connect improvements in word-level accuracy to business metrics, such as revenue and user engagement, can help bridge the gap between technical and business goals.
 - Evaluating the ethical implications of a project is essential. Consider whether the project creates net positive societal value and whether it is fair and free from bias
