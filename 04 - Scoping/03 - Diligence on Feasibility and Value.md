# Diligence on Feasibility and Value

 - The diligence step involves assessing the technical feasibility and value of a project before starting;
 - This means that you have to determine if the project can be technically built;
 - You can use existing research or competitor projects as benchmarks to check for feasibility.
  
# Two-Dimensional Matrix for Feasibility

 - Lets consider a 2 by 2 matrix:
    - **Data Type:** unstructured (e.g., images, speech) vs. Structured (e.g., transaction records);
    - **Project Type:** new (building a system for the first time) vs. old (improving an existing system).

# Unstructured vs. Structured Data

**Unstructured Data**

 - Assess if a human can perform the task with the same data the algorithm will receive;
 - **Example:** Evaluating if humans can detect scratches on smartphones from images.

**Structured Data**

 - Assess the availability of predictive features (inputs) for the target output (predictions);
 - **Example:** Past purchase data can predict future purchases; weather data can predict foot traffic.

# New vs. Old Projects

**New Project**

 - Consider whether the technology required to implement the solution is accessible and if the project can be accomplished within the available timeframe and resources;
 - Determine if there are existing benchmarks or similar projects that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed task.

**Old Projects**

 - Compare desired performance improvements to human capabilities;
 - If the goal exceeds HLP, the project may be harder to achieve.
