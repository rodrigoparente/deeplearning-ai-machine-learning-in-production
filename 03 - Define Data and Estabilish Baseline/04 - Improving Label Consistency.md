# Improving Label Consistency

 - Identify examples with inconsistent labels and have multiple labelers evaluate the same examples.
 - Consider having the same labeler re-label after a break to assess self-consistency.
 - Facilitate discussions among labelers, subject matter experts, and machine learning engineers to reach a consensus on labeling definitions. Document these agreements to update labeling instructions.
 - If labelers find the input data insufficient, consider improving the data collection process (e.g., enhancing image quality through better lighting).
 - After improving labeling definitions or input quality, label more data and repeat the consistency-checking process if disagreements persist.

# Common Outcomes of the Process

 - **Standardization of Labels:** labelers may agree on a standardized convention for labeling audio clips or images;
 - **Merging Classes:** if distinctions between classes (e.g., deep vs. shallow scratches) are unclear, merging them into a single class can reduce inconsistencies;
 - **Creating an Uncertainty Class:** for ambiguous cases (e.g., scratches of uncertain severity), introduce a new class for borderline examples, helping to clarify labeling;
 - **Dealing with Ambiguity:** fn cases of unintelligible audio, labeling it as "unintelligible" instead of forcing specific transcriptions can improve consistency.

# Strategies for Small vs. Large Datasets

 - For **small datasets**, involve all labelers in discussions to address inconsistencies directly.
 - For **large datasets**, establish consistent definitions with a small group and disseminate these instructions to a larger labeling team.
 - **Consensus Labeling:** While having multiple labelers vote on examples can enhance accuracy, it should be a last resort after attempting to establish clearer labeling guidelines.
