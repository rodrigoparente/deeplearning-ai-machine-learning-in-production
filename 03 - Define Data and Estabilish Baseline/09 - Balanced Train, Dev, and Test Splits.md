# Balanced Train, Dev, and Test Splits

 - Randomly splitting a dataset into training, development, and test sets can lead to imbalanced distributions, especially in small datasets;
 - In large datasets, a random split is likely to yield a representative distribution of classes due to the sheer volume of data.
 - A balanced split ensures that each subset accurately represents the overall dataset distribution, which is crucial for reliable model evaluation;
