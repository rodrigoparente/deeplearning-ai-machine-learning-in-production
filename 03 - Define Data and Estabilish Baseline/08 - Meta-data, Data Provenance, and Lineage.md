# Meta-data, Data Provenance, and Lineage

 - These concepts are crucial in managing complex machine learning pipelines, helping track and maintain data as it flows through various stages.
 - **Data Provenance** refers to the detailed history and origins of a dataset, including how, where, and by whom the data was created, collected, or derived;
 - **Data Lineage** tracks the sequence of steps from raw data to the final output, ensuring transparency in how data has been processed;
 - **Metadata** is any relevant information about the dataset that can help trace issues back to their origin and understanding their impact on the pipeline.

# Tools and Practices

 - **Documentation:** helps reconstruct data provenance and lineage in the absence of formal tools;
 - **MLOps Tools:** tools like TensorFlow Transform can aid in managing data provenance and lineage, though the field is still developing.
