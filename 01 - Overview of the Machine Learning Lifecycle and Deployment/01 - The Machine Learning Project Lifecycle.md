# Introduction

Imagine the process of deploying a computer vision system for automated visual defect inspection in a manufacturing setting. 

 - The process begins with training a model to detect defects, such as scratches on smartphones, using a dataset of images;
 - Once the model is trained, it must be integrated into a production environment, which involves:
    - Setting up API interfaces;
    - Deploying the model on a prediction server (either in the cloud or at the edge);
    - Ensuring the system works reliably under real-world conditions.

A key problem that can arise is the potential for "concept drift" or "data drift," where changes in the factory's lighting conditions, for example, can cause the model to perform poorly compared to its performance on the original test set. This use case emphasizes how deploying machine learning models in production requires much more than just the machine learning code; it involves significant additional software development to handle data management, system monitoring, and other tasks necessary for a robust deployment. The success in a development environment (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) does not guarantee success in production, as there is often a significant gap between proof-of-concept and production deployment.

# Steps of an ML Project

 1. **Scoping:** define the project and objectives;
 2. **Data Collection:** acquire and define the necessary data;
 3. **Model Training:** select and train the machine learning model;
 4. **Deployment:** deploy the model in a production environment;
 5. **Monitoring and Maintenance:** continuously monitor the system to adapt to changes.

# Case Study: Speech Recognition

 1. **Scoping:**
    - Define the project (e.g., speech recognition for voice search);
    - Estimate key metrics: accuracy, latency, throughput;
    - Assess resource needs: time, compute power, budget, and timeline.

 2. **Data Collection:**
    - Define, label, and organize data consistently;
    - Address challenges in transcription consistency (e.g., handling noise, silence, volume normalization);
    - Adjust and improve datasets for better model performance in production.

 3. **Modeling:**
    - Select and train the model using a combination of code, data, and hyperparameters;
    - Focus on optimizing data quality and hyperparameters rather than just the model code;
    - Use error analysis to target specific data improvements for better accuracy.

 4. **Deployment:**
    - Implement the system on an edge device (e.g., mobile phone) with local software;
    - Use voice activity detection (VAD) to process audio before sending it to a cloud-based prediction server;
    - Display transcripts and search results on the device.

 5. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
    - Continuously monitor the system for data drift (e.g., changes in user demographics, like younger voices);
    - Collect new data and retrain the model as needed to maintain performance;
    - Address concept drift by implementing timely fixes to ensure the system remains effective in production.
