# Model-Centric vs. Data-Centric AI Development

After error analysis, you decide to enhance the performance of your learning algorithm on a specific data category, e.g., speech with car noise in the background.

**Model-Centric Approach**
 
 - Focuses on improving the model with the existing data;
 - Common in academic research where the goal is to perform well on a fixed benchmark dataset;
 - Involves holding data constant while iteratively refining the model.

**Data-Centric Approach**

 - Prioritizes the quality of the data over the model;
 - Focuses on systematically improving data quality using tools like error analysis and data augmentation;
 - Holds the model or code constant while iteratively enhancing the dataset;
 - For many applications, a high-quality dataset allows multiple models to perform well.

# Importance of Data Augmentation

 - Data augmentation is highlighted as a key method for improving dataset quality;
 - The next steps involve exploring data augmentation techniques to further enhance the performance of the learning algorithm.
