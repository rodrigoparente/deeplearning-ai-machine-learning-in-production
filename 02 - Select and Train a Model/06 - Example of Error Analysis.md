# Error Analysis Example: Speech Recognition
  
 - Typically done using spreadsheets (e.g., Google Sheets, Excel), where mislabeled examples from the development set are reviewed;
 - Examples are tagged based on the type of error (e.g., background noise, low bandwidth) to identify common error sources;
 - As more errors are analyzed, new tags may be introduced, and the dataset is revisited to apply these tags, helping to refine the understanding of error sources.

# Key Questions in Error Analysis

 - Determines the importance of working on issues related to a specific tag (e.g., if 12% of errors are due to car noise);
 - Evaluates how challenging certain tagged examples are (e.g., if 18% of data with car noise is misclassified);
 - Assesses the overall significance of a tagged category within the entire dataset;
 - Measures potential improvement by comparing current performance to human-level performance or other benchmarks.

By categorizing errors through tags and analyzing these categories, the goal is to identify specific areas where the modelâ€™s performance can be most effectively improved.

# Prioritizing Areas to Focus On
  
Considering the following table

| Type          | Accuracy | HLP | Gap to HLP | % of data | Increase in Performance |
|---------------|----------|-----|------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Clean Speech  | 94%      | 95% | 1%         | 60%       | 0.60%                   |
| Car Noise     | 89%      | 93% | 4%         | 4%        | 0.16%                   |
| People Noise  | 87%      | 89% | 2%         | 30%       | 0.60%                   |
| Low Bandwidth | 70%      | 70% | 0%         | 6%        | 0 %                     |

For example, if 4% of your data is car noise, and improving its accuracy by 4% would result in a 0.16% improvement in overall accuracy, it might be more worthwhile to focus on people noise, which represent 30% of data, and improving its accuracy by 2% would result in a 0.6% improvement in accuracy;

# Factors to Consider in Prioritization
 
 - Compare current performance to human-level performance or another baseline to determine potential gains.
 - Assess how frequently a category appears in your dataset, as more frequent categories might have a greater impact.
 - Consider the ease of improving accuracy in a given category, especially if clear strategies like data augmentation are available.
 - Evaluate the importance of enhancing performance in specific categories, such as speech recognition in noisy environments for safety and usability..

# Strategic Data Collection

 - Once a category is identified as a priority, consider collecting more data or improving data quality specifically for that category.
 - For instance, to improve performance on speech with car noise, you might collect more data with that noise or use data augmentation techniques
 
Instead of collecting more data indiscriminately, this focused approach allows you to be more efficient, targeting the most impactful areas for improvement.
