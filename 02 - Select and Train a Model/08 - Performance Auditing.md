# Performance Auditing

 - Even with good accuracy or F1 scores, a final performance audit can prevent significant post-deployment issues;
 - This process helps ensure that the algorithm works well across different scenarios and demographics.

# Framework for Performance Auditing

**Step 1: Brainstorm Potential Issues**

 - Identify ways the system could fail, such as poor performance on certain demographic subsets (e.g., different ethnicities, genders);
 - Consider errors like false positives/negatives, performance on rare classes, and biases.

**Step 2: Establish Metrics**

 - Develop metrics to evaluate the algorithm against the identified potential issues;
 - Common practice includes evaluating performance on "slices" or subsets of data (e.g., specific demographic groups or device types).

**Step 3: Use MLOps Tools for Automatic Evaluation**

 - Tools like TensorFlow Model Analysis (TFMA) can help automate the evaluation of model performance on different data slices.

# Example: Speech Recognition System

 - **Potential Issues:**
     - Performance discrepancies across different genders and ethnicities;
     - Accuracy differences based on the perceived accent of speakers;
     - Performance variations across different devices with different microphones;
     - Mistranscriptions, especially those that result in offensive or rude words.
 - **Metrics:**
     - Measure accuracy across different demographics, devices, and check for rude words in transcriptions.

# Final Tip

 - Collaborative brainstorming, including external input, can reduce the risk of overlooking potential issues;
 - Proactively addressing these concerns before deployment increases the chances of a successful and fair system in production.
