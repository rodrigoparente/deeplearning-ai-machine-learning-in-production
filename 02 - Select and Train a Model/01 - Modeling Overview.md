# Model Development Overview

The model development can be divided into two categories:

**Model Selection and Training**

 - Choose the appropriate model architecture based on the problem and data;
 - Train the model using the prepared data, optimizing for performance metrics;
 - Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

**Performing Error Analysis**

 - Conduct error analysis to spot failure patterns or biases in model predictions;
 - Utilize confusion matrices, precision-recall, and ROC curves to assess performance across classes;
 - Create a feedback loop to integrate error analysis insights into future model iterations.

# Model-Centric vs. Data-Centric AI Development

 - **Model-Centric:** emphasizes choosing the right model, such as selecting the appropriate neural network architecture;
 - **Data-Centric:** focuses on ensuring the algorithm is fed high-quality data, which can be more impactful for practical projects.

# Importance of Data Quality

 - For many projects, the algorithm or model is basically a solved problem;
 - Because of that, high-quality data is crucial for the efficient performance of machine learning systems;
 - Instead of accumulating more data, the recommendation is to use tools to improve existing data in the most efficient way possible.
