# Importance of Establishing a Baseline

 - Establishing a baseline is a crucial first step in a machine learning project, providing a reference point for further improvements;
 - A baseline helps determine what is realistically achievable and guides efforts towards areas with the most potential for improvement.

# Structured vs. Unstructured Data

 - **Unstructured Data**: images, audio, and natural language;
 - **Structured Data**: databases and spreadsheets.
  
In tasks involving unstructured data Human-Level Performance (HLP) is often a useful baseline.

# Alternative Baseline Methods 

 - **Literature Search/State-of-the-Art:** reviewing existing research or open-source results can provide a benchmark for performance;
  - **Quick-and-Dirty Implementation:** rapid, simple implementation of a model can offer an initial performance estimate.
  - **Previous System Performance:** if an older system exists, its performance can serve as a baseline for improvement.

Establishing a baseline can help estimate the best possible performance (Bayes error) and highlight areas where further improvement may not be feasible.

# Challenges in Business Expectations

 - Business teams may pressure machine learning teams to commit to high accuracy levels without a baseline, which is risky and unrealistic;
 - It's advisable to push back and request time to establish a baseline before making any accuracy guarantees, ensuring a more successful project outcome.
